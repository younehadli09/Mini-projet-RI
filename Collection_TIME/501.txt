INDIA UNDER THE BANYAN TREE MEETING UNDER A GAUDY CIRCUS TENT IN THE FABLED PINK CITY OF JAIPUR, THE LEADERS OF INDIA'S RULING CONGRESS  CAR10001 PARTY TALKED THEMSELVES HOARSE LAST WEEK IN THE FIRST INTENSIVE EFFORT  CAR10002 TO REFURBISH THEIR POLITICAL IMAGE SINCE INDEPENDENCE CAME IN 1947.     CAR10003 PROPPED ON SAUSAGE-SHAPED BOLSTERS UNDER A HUGE PORTRAIT OF GANDHI, THE CAR10004 DHOTI-CLAD POLITICIANS PLEDGED "SELF-SACRIFICE" AND "DEMOCRATIC         CAR10005 SOCIALISM"--AND AT MEALTIMES ROARED OFF IN FIN-TAILED LIMOUSINES.       CAR10006 ENDORSING "NONALIGNMENT," PARTY LEADERS WARNED RITUALISTICALLY AGAINST  CAR10007 "ENTANGLEMENT WITH MILITARY BLOCS"- - EVEN AS U. S., BRITISH AND        CAR10008 INDIAN WARPLANES FLEW OVER NEW DELHI IN JOINT AIR EXERCISES.  AFTER     CAR10009 A SIX-HOUR DEBATE ON THE DEFINITION OF SOCIALISM, THE DELEGATES         CAR10010 ADJOURNED THE TWO-DAY CONFERENCE AND WENT HOME TO GIVE THE SUBJECT MORE CAR10011 THOUGHT.                                                                CAR10012 BOOST FOR INDIRA.  ANOTHER SUBJECT THEY THOUGHT ABOUT, ONE THAT HAS     CAR10013 ALMOST BECOME A NATIONAL OBSESSION, IS THE SUCCESSOR TO JAWAHARLAL      CAR10014 NEHRU, 74.  INDIA TODAY IS STILL SMARTING FROM THE SAVAGE BEATING IT    CAR10015 TOOK AT THE HANDS OF RED CHINA LAST FALL, THE ECONOMY IS FALTERING      CAR10016 UNDER BUREAUCRATIC CONTROLS, AND THE FACTION-RIVEN GOVERNMENT IS        CAR10017 FLAWED WITH CORRUPTION.  RESTIVE POLITICIANS SAY BLUNTLY THAT ALL       CAR10018 THEIR PROBLEMS CANNOT BE SOLVED BY THE STOOPED, CAREWORN PRIME          CAR10019 MINISTER AND THE ELDERLY, OUT-OF-TOUCH CONGRESS PARTY LEADERSHIP.       CAR10020 A CELEBRATED CRITICISM OF NEHRU IS THAT HE RESEMBLES INDIA'S            CAR10021 BANYAN TREE, WHICH PROVERBIALLY KILLS EVERY OTHER ORGANISM THAT         CAR10022 GROWS IN ITS SHADE.  IN THE WAKE OF THREE PARLIAMENTARY BY-ELECTION     CAR10023 DEFEATS LAST SPRING, NEHRU ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD ASK A DOZEN TOP      CAR10024 CABINET AND STATE MINISTERS TO RESIGN FROM THE GOVERNMENT IN ORDER      CAR10025 TO LET THEM GO TO WORK REVITALIZING THE PARTY ORGANIZATION AND          CAR10026 REBUILDING ITS STRENGTH AMONG THE VOTERS.  BUT THE KAMARAJ* PLAN        CAR10027 WAS REALLY USED BY THE PRIME MINISTER AS A RUSE TO FLUSH OUT ALL THE    CAR10028 TOP CONTENDERS FOR HIS OWN JOB.  THERE IS EVEN WIDESPREAD               CAR10029 SUSPICION THAT NEHRU FORCED THE RESIGNATIONS OF HIS ABLEST MINISTERS    CAR10030 IN ORDER TO CLEAR THE WAY FOR HIS DAUGHTER, IMPERIOUS INDIRA GANDHI,    CAR10031 45, WIDOW OF A BACKBENCH CONGRESS POLITICIAN (NO KIN TO THE MAHATMA),   CAR10032 WHO HAS LONG BEEN THE PRIME MINISTER'S CLOSEST CONFIDANTE (HE           CAR10033 CALLS HER INDU, OR MOON), OFFICIAL HOSTESS AND POLITICAL                CAR10034 TROUBLESHOOTER.                                                         CAR10035 RULER OF THE WORLD.  BUT DISCOUNTING INDIRA AS A REAL POLITICAL         CAR10036 CONTENDER, THE CHOICE OF MOST PARTY MEMBERS AT PRESENT IS FORMER HOME   CAR10037 MINISTER LAL BAHADUR SHASTRI, 59, AN HONEST IF COLORLESS POLITICIAN WHO,CAR10038 LIKE HIS LEADER, COMES FROM UTTAR PRADESH, INDIA'S MOST POPULOUS        CAR10039 STATE AND THE TRADITIONAL BREEDING GROUND OF CONGRESS PARTY LEADERS.    CAR10040 IF SHASTRI IS DISQUALIFIED--HE HAD A HEART ATTACK IN 1959--A            CAR10041 LEADING CONTENDER FOR THE PRIMEMINISTERSHIP WOULD PROBABLY BE           CAR10042 S. K. PATIL, 63, A RIGHT-WINGER WHO RUNS BOMBAY WITH BRISK EFFICIENCY   CAR10043 AND UNTIL THE CABINET PURGE COPED ABLY WITH THE THANKLESS JOB OF        CAR10044 FOOD MINISTER, THOUGH GRAIN SHORTAGES PROMPTED THE CRACK THAT           CAR10045 HE "GAVE INDIA FOOD--FOR THOUGHT."                                      CAR10046 MORARJI DESAI, 67, A STERN ASCETIC WHO WAS NEHRU'S FINANCE              CAR10047 MINISTER AND WAS ONCE A FAVORITE TO SUCCEED HIM, HAS LOST MUCH OF HIS   CAR10048 POPULARITY IN THE PAST YEAR, LARGELY AS A RESULT OF HIS DRACONIAN       CAR10049 MEASURES TO RAISE TAXES FOR THE DEFENSE EFFORT, BUT COULD STILL BE      CAR10050 THE POWERFUL RIGHT WING'S CHOICE.                                       CAR10051 AS FOR NEHRU, HE IS DETERMINED TO HOLD ON TO HIS POST INDEFINITELY,     CAR10052 BUT EVEN INDIA'S MOST POPULAR MAN OCCASIONALLY FACES THE                CAR10053 LIMITATIONS OF FAME IN A COUNTRY THAT IS STILL ONLY 24 PER CENT         CAR10054 LITERATE.  IN A SURVEY OF VILLAGERS LIVING LESS THAN 20 MILES FROM      CAR10055 BUSTLING HYDERABAD, UNIVERSITY RESEARCHERS REPORTED THAT PEASANTS       CAR10056 VARIOUSLY IDENTIFIED NEHRU AS "HEAD OF A GERMAN STATE," "RULER          CAR10057 OF THE WORLD," AND "SOME BRAHMAN."  *NAMED FOR KAMARAJ NADAR,           CAR10058 FORMER CHIEF MINISTER OF MADRAS, WHO FIRST EMPLOYED IT TO               CAR10059 ADVANTAGE IN HIS OWN STATE ADMINISTRATION.
