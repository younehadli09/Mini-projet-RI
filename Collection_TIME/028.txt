THE CONGO THE UN  DRIVES IMPLACABLY AHEAD BELGIAN CEMENT WORKER ALBERT VERBRUGGHE WAS DRIVING HIS WIFE AND ANOTHER WOMAN DOWN A QUIET STREET IN THE COPPER TOWN OF JADOTVILLE ONE DAY LAST WEEK, WHEN HE SUDDENLY HEARD THE CLATTER OF GUNFIRE . PULLING THE TRIGGERS FOR NO APPARENT REASON WERE NERVOUS INDIAN TROOPS OF THE ADVANCING UNITED NATIONS FORCE . VERBRUGGHE SLAMMED HIS LITTLE VOLKSWAGEN TO A HALT . HIS WIFE WAS ALREADY DEAD, THE OTHER WOMAN DYING . WITH AN ANGUISHED SCREAM, VERBRUGGHE STUMBLED OUT, BLOOD STREAMING FROM A WOUND UNDER HIS EYE . " MY WIFE IS KILLED, " HE CRIED . " WHY, WHY, WHY ? " THE SAME QUESTION, IN A LARGER CONTEXT, WAS BEING ASKED IN MANY CAPITALS LAST WEEK . FOR THE THIRD TIME IN 15 MONTHS, THE WORLD WAS HORRIFIED WITNESS TO THE SPECTACLE OF FOREIGN SOLDIERS, AIDED BY THE US, SEIZING THE TOWNS AND FIRING ON NATIVE SOLDIERS OF THE CONGO . TO MANY, THE UN'S VERY PRESENCE IN THE AFRICAN LAND WAS OF DOUBTFUL WISDOM . BUT IN ANY CASE, THE BLAZING GUNS AND SWOOPING PLANES OF THE UN  HARDLY FITTED THE PACIFYING INTENT OF ITS ORIGINAL CONGO MANDATE . " IT IS AN UNSPEAKABLE TRAGEDY, " SAID CONNECTICUT'S DEMOCRATIC SENATOR THOMAS DODD, " THAT THE WORLD ORGANIZATION WHICH WAS SET UP TO PREVENT WAR AND PRESERVE THE PEACE SHOULD BE STARTING WARS . " IN LONDON, 90 TORY MPS ACCUSED THE UN  OF ACTING " CONTRARY TO ITS OWN CHARTER . " EVEN PRESIDENT KENNEDY, WHO LAST WEEK ORDERED THE US  TO BEGIN SHIPPING 2F-TON TRUCKS, ARMORED CARS AND TRANSPORT PLANES TO THE UN  CONGO FORCE, WAS REPORTED TO BE ALARMED AT THE DISORDER THAT AROSE FROM THE UN  SHOOTING . ON TO JADOTVILLE . BUT THERE WAS NO TURNING BACK ON THE BASIC DECISION THAT HAD BEEN MADE . KATANGA'S SECESSIONIST PRESIDENT MOISE TSHOMBE HAD USED EVERY SLY TRICK IN THE BOOK TO FRUSTRATE EFFORTS TO REUNITE HIS REBELLIOUS, COPPERRICH PROVINCE WITH THE REST OF THE CONGO . NOW, UN  SECRETARY-GENERAL U THANT, WITH US  ENCOURAGEMENT, WAS DETERMINED TO END THE KATANGA PROBLEM ONCE AND FOR ALL . THE OCCASION HAPPENED TO BE THE COLLAPSE OF DISCIPLINE AMONG TSHOMBE'S BOOZY, RAGTAG 20,000-MAN GENDARMERIE . WHEN THEY BEGAN SHOOTING AT UN  SOLDIERS IN KATANGA A FORTNIGHT AGO, THE UN  REPLIED WITH ALL THE POWER AT ITS COMMAND . LAST WEEK IRISH INFANTRYMEN MARCHED INTO KIPUSHI, SITE OF COPPER MINES AT THE RHODESIAN BORDER . ETHIOPIAN UN TROOPS ALREADY OCCUPIED ELISABETHVILLE ITSELF . BUT THE BIG PRIZE WAS JADOTVILLE, A TOWN OF 90,000, WHERE THE GIANT UNION MINIERE MINERAL OUTFIT PRODUCES ONE-THIRD OF ITS COPPER (110,000 TONS) AND THREE-FOURTHS OF ITS COBALT (6,600 TONS) EACH YEAR . TOWARD JADOTVILLE, 70 MILES FROM ELISABETHVILLE, MOVED A TWO-MILE-LONG COLUMN OF INDIANS COMMANDED BY BRIGADIER REGINALD NORONHA, A GUTTY SOLDIER WHO MUNCHED HARDBOILED EGGS WHILE MORTAR SHELLS BURST AROUND HIM . WEAPONS AFLOAT . ALARMED AT THE PROSPECT OF DAMAGE TO MINE INSTALLATIONS IN WHICH BOTH BRITAIN AND BELGIUM HAD HEAVY INVESTMENTS, BRITISH UN  AMBASSADOR SIR PATRICK DEAN AND BELGIUM'S WALTER LORIDAN DEMANDED ASSURANCES FROM THANT THAT THE UN  FORCES WOULD GO NO FARTHER . THANT ASSURED THEM THAT THEY HAD HALTED AT THE LUFIRA RIVER . THAT WAS CORRECT, UP TO A POINT . WITH THREE BRIDGES DOWN, THE INDIANS STOPPED AT THE LUFIRA ALL RIGHT, BUT ONLY LONG ENOUGH TO RIG ROPES AND PULLEYS TO A SWIMMING FLOAT AND FERRY 120-MM . MORTARS, RECOILLESS RIFLES AND JEEPS ACROSS THE STREAM . NORONHA HAD NO ORDERS TO TAKE JADOTVILLE BUT THEN AGAIN, HE HAD NO ORDERS NOT TO SO HE KEPT ON GOING . UNOPPOSED, THE INDIANS TROOPED INTO JADOTVILLE WITH NORONHA HIMSELF HEADING A COLUN F JEEPS . THINGS WERE GOING LESS SMOOTHLY BACK AT UN  HEADQUARTERS IN MANHATTAN . CONVINCED THAT THANT HAD DECEIVED THEM ABOUT JADOTVILLE, BELGIAN AND BRITISH DIPLOMATS WANTED TO KNOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED . THANT INTIMATED THAT HIS AIDES IN THE CONGO HAD EXCEEDED THEIR ORDERS . " THERE OCCURRED A SERIOUS BREAKDOWN, " A SPOKESMAN SAID, " IN EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION BETWEEN THE UN  HEADQUARTERS AND THE LEOPOLDVILLE OFFICE . " OFF TO LEOPOLDVILLE " TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THIS LAPSE AND TO ENSURE IT WILL NOT RECUR " FLEW UN  UNDER SECRETARY RALPH BUNCHE . BUT ONCE THERE, BUNCHE ANNOUNCED THAT THE UN  STILL WANTED " FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT " THROUGHOUT ALL OF KATANGA, AND ADDED : " THE TASK
